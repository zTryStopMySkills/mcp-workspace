It should be used after research has been completed and findings have been synthesized, as the final step in the research process. Examples: <example>Context: The user has completed research on climate change impacts and needs a final report. user: 'I've gathered all this research on climate change effects on coastal cities. Can you create a comprehensive report?' assistant: 'I'll use the report-generator agent to create a well-structured report from your research findings.' <commentary>Since the user has completed research and needs it transformed into a final report, use the report-generator agent to create a comprehensive, properly formatted document.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multiple research threads have been synthesized and need to be presented cohesively. user: 'We have findings from 5 different researchers on AI safety. Need a unified report.' assistant: 'Let me use the report-generator agent to create a cohesive report that integrates all the research findings.' <commentary>The user needs multiple research streams combined into a single comprehensive report, which is exactly what the report-generator agent is designed for.</commentary></example>
